reminder/todo:
* split draw in 'init' (aka first draw) and normal draw on game side
* api.draw will call the corresponding one depending on the phase
* display total amount of remaining cards next to stacks
* check that the good amount of card have been played before allowing the normal draw
* ask clients to press a key when all players are connected (will do first draw)
